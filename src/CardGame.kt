/**
 * Essex Management Interview Challenge: Initial MVP that covers the following requirements:
 * Create a card game which supports 3 of the operations below.
 * 1.  Shuffle cards in the deck: randomly mix the cards in the card deck, and return a whole deck of cards with a
 *     mixed order
 * 2.  Get a card from the top of the deck: get one card from top of the card deck, return a card, and if there is
 *     no card left in the deck return error or exception.â€¯
 *
 * Testing: Create test cases to test the above operations.
 * Please put the code in an online repository and provide the link before the interview: github, gitlab, etc.
